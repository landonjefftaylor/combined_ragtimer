Welcome to RAGTIMER for trace generation.
This is a work in progress. Please submit bug reports.

Constructing a dependency graph
Finished constructing a dependency graph, found these prefixes:

The traces recorded and the information on those traces are stored in 'reaction_list.txt'

The traces by themselves (i.e. for simulation and commuting) are found in 'trace_list.txt'

Welcome to RAGTIMER. At present, this is two tools joined together. We are working on joining them together more seamlessly but appreciate your patience with this prototype tool.
I will generate traces, then commute.
I am assuming you have placed your model in the following files:
model.ragtimer (in the RAGTIMER format; see README)
model.prop (file with property without time constraints in first line, i.e., x=10 )
model.sm (prism model file)
model.csl (prism csl property)

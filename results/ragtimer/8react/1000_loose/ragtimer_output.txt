Welcome to RAGTIMER for trace generation.
This is a work in progress. Please submit bug reports.

Constructing a dependency graph
Finished constructing a dependency graph, found these prefixes:
R5 
R3 R5 
R8 R5 

/home/landonjefftaylor/combined_ragtimer/_ragtimer
Finding 1000
For each prefix: 500
--------------------------------------------------
Testing Prefix R3 R5 
--------------------------------------------------
starting to run initial test
finished initial test
The iters recorded for this initial example is 430
Running test for 100 simulation runs in group 1 of 5
Running test for 100 simulation runs in group 2 of 5
Running test for 100 simulation runs in group 3 of 5
Running test for 100 simulation runs in group 4 of 5
Running test for 100 simulation runs in group 5 of 5
finished randomized testing
Run 110 did not reach the target state

Run 124 did not reach the target state

Run 202 did not reach the target state

Run 361 did not reach the target state


The traces recorded and the information on those traces are stored in 'reaction_list.txt'

The traces by themselves (i.e. for simulation and commuting) are found in 'trace_list.txt'
Probability in this prefix: 0.000000e+00
Running total probability:  0.0

Welcome to RAGTIMER. At present, this is two tools joined together. We are working on joining them together more seamlessly but appreciate your patience with this prototype tool.
I will generate traces, then commute.
I am assuming you have placed your model in the following files:
model.ragtimer (in the RAGTIMER format; see README)
model.prop (file with property without time constraints in first line, i.e., x=10 )
model.sm (prism model file)
model.csl (prism csl property)

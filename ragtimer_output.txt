Welcome to RAGTIMER for trace generation.
This is a work in progress. Please submit bug reports.

Constructing a dependency graph
Finished constructing a dependency graph, found these prefixes:
R1 

/home/landonjefftaylor/combined_ragtimer/_ragtimer
Finding 100
For each prefix: 100
--------------------------------------------------
Testing Prefix R1 
--------------------------------------------------
starting to run initial test
finished initial test
The iters recorded for this initial example is 56
Running test for 100 simulation runs in group 1 of 1
finished randomized testing

The traces recorded and the information on those traces are stored in 'reaction_list.txt'

The traces by themselves (i.e. for simulation and commuting) are found in 'trace_list.txt'
